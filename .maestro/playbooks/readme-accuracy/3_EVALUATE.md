# Usage Documentation Gap Evaluation

## Context

- **Playbook:** Usage
- **Agent:** vue-naive-admin
- **Project:** D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin
- **Auto Run Folder:** D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks
- **Loop:** 00001

## Objective

Evaluate each documentation gap from the discovery phase and assign importance and effort ratings. This prioritization ensures we fix the most impactful gaps first - the ones that would confuse or frustrate users the most.

## Instructions

1. **Read the gaps list** from `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`
2. **Rate each gap** for user importance and fix effort
3. **Assign status** based on ratings
4. **Output prioritized plan** to `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`

## Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] **Evaluate gaps (or skip if empty)**: Read `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`. If it contains no gaps OR all gaps have already been evaluated in `LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`, mark this task complete without changes. Otherwise, rate each gap by USER IMPORTANCE (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) and FIX EFFORT (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD). Mark gaps with HIGH/CRITICAL importance and EASY/MEDIUM effort as PENDING for auto-fix. Output to `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`.

  Completed in `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`: evaluated 12 gaps, marked 7 as `PENDING`, 4 as `PENDING - NEEDS REVIEW`, and 1 as `WON'T DO`.

## Rating Criteria

### User Importance Levels

| Level        | Criteria                                                  | Examples                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Blocks users from basic usage, causes confusion or errors | Missing installation steps, wrong command syntax, stale getting-started    |
| **HIGH**     | Affects common workflows, users will definitely encounter | Missing major feature docs, incorrect configuration, stale common commands |
| **MEDIUM**   | Affects regular usage, users may encounter                | Missing secondary features, incomplete examples, minor inaccuracies        |
| **LOW**      | Affects advanced/edge cases, few users will notice        | Missing advanced options, incomplete edge case docs, cosmetic issues       |

### Fix Effort Levels

| Level      | Criteria                                             | Examples                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EASY**   | Simple text addition or removal, clear what to write | Add one-liner feature mention, remove stale section, fix typo   |
| **MEDIUM** | Requires some investigation, moderate text changes   | Add feature description with examples, rewrite outdated section |
| **HARD**   | Extensive rewrite, requires deep understanding       | Major section restructure, comprehensive feature documentation  |

### Auto-Fix Criteria

Gaps will be auto-fixed if:

- **User Importance:** CRITICAL or HIGH
- **Fix Effort:** EASY or MEDIUM

Gaps marked `PENDING - NEEDS REVIEW` if:

- Complex changes that need maintainer input
- Unclear what the correct documentation should be

Gaps marked `WON'T DO` if:

- **User Importance:** LOW with HARD effort
- Internal features that don't need user docs
- Intentionally undocumented (internal use only)

## Output Format

Create/update `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md` with:

````markdown

  [Draft of the README content to add/change]
  ```

  ```

  ```

### DOC-002: [Feature/Gap Name]

1. **DOC-001** - [name] (CRITICAL, blocks getting started)
2. **DOC-002** - [name] (HIGH, common workflow)
3. **DOC-003** - [name] (HIGH, related to DOC-002)
   ...

## README Section Updates Needed

| Section           | Gaps to Fix      | Action Needed        |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Getting Started   | DOC-001, DOC-003 | Add missing steps    |
| Features          | DOC-002, DOC-005 | Add new features     |
| Configuration     | DOC-004          | Update outdated info |
| [removed section] | DOC-006          | Remove stale content |

```

## Guidelines

- **Prioritize user-facing impact** - What would frustrate a new user?
- **Consider the README audience** - New users, not internal devs
- **Group related fixes** - Features that should be documented together
- **Draft actual content** - Include proposed README text where possible
- **Note dependencies** - Some fixes may depend on others

## How to Know You're Done

This task is complete when ONE of the following is true:

**Option A - Evaluated gaps:**
1. You've read `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`
2. You've evaluated gaps with importance and effort ratings
3. You've output the prioritized plan to `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`
4. Each gap has a status (PENDING, PENDING - NEEDS REVIEW, or WON'T DO)

**Option B - No gaps to evaluate:**
1. `LOOP_00001_GAPS.md` contains no gaps, OR
2. All gaps have already been evaluated in `LOOP_00001_PLAN.md`
3. Mark this task complete without making changes

This graceful handling of empty states prevents the pipeline from stalling when no documentation gaps are found.
