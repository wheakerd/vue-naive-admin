# Usage Documentation Gap Discovery

## Context

- **Playbook:** Usage
- **Agent:** vue-naive-admin
- **Project:** D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin
- **Auto Run Folder:** D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks
- **Loop:** 00001

## Objective

Compare the feature inventory against the README to identify specific documentation gaps. This includes features missing from the README, stale documentation for removed features, and inaccurate descriptions.

## Instructions

1. **Read the feature inventory** from `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`
2. **Identify discrepancies** between code and README
3. **Classify each gap** by type (missing, stale, inaccurate)
4. **Output findings** to `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`

## Gap Discovery Checklist

- [x] **Find documentation gaps (or skip if no discrepancies)**: Read LOOP_00001_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md and compare features in code vs README. If the feature inventory shows NO discrepancies (code and README are fully aligned), mark this task complete without creating LOOP_00001_GAPS.md. Otherwise, identify: (1) features in code but missing from README, (2) features in README but removed from code, (3) features documented inaccurately. Output findings to `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`.

  Completed 2026-05-26: Created `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md` with 12 documentation gaps: 9 missing feature/documentation areas, 1 stale command-script gap, and 2 inaccurate version guidance gaps.

## How to Know You're Done

This task is complete when ONE of the following is true:

**Option A - Found gaps:**

1. You've compared features in code vs README
2. You've identified one or more discrepancies
3. You've documented all gaps in `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md`

**Option B - No discrepancies found:**

1. The feature inventory shows code and README are fully aligned
2. There are no missing, stale, inaccurate, or incomplete documentation items
3. Mark this task complete without creating a gaps file

This graceful handling of empty states prevents the pipeline from stalling when the README is already complete.

## Gap Types

### MISSING - Feature exists in code but not in README

- New features added without documentation
- Major functionality users should know about
- Configuration options not explained
- Commands or shortcuts not listed

### STALE - Feature in README but not in code

- Features that were removed
- Deprecated functionality still documented
- Old command names or syntax
- References to removed files or options

### INACCURATE - Feature exists but description is wrong

- Changed behavior not reflected in docs
- Incorrect examples or syntax
- Wrong default values documented
- Outdated screenshots or demos referenced

### INCOMPLETE - Feature documented but lacking detail

- Missing important options or flags
- No examples for complex features
- Missing error handling guidance
- Unclear or ambiguous descriptions

## Output Format

Create/update `D:\projects\personal\loicduong\vue-naive-admin/.maestro/playbooks/LOOP_00001_GAPS.md` with:

```markdown

## Gap List

### GAP-001: [Feature Name]

- **Type:** [MISSING | STALE | INACCURATE | INCOMPLETE]
- **Feature:** [name of the feature]
- **Code Location:** `[path/to/file]` (if applicable)
- **README Location:** [section name / line numbers] (if applicable)
- **Description:**
  [What the gap is - e.g., "Feature X allows users to do Y but is not mentioned in README"]
- **Evidence:**
  - Code: [what the code shows]
  - README: [what the README says, or "not mentioned"]
- **User Impact:** [Why a user would care about this gap]

### GAP-002: [Feature Name]

- **Type:** [MISSING | STALE | INACCURATE | INCOMPLETE]
  ...

## Gaps by Type

### MISSING Features

| Gap ID  | Feature | Code Location | User Impact |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| GAP-XXX | [name]  | [location]    | [impact]    |
| ...     | ...     | ...           | ...         |

### STALE Documentation

| Gap ID  | Feature | README Section | What Changed         |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| GAP-XXX | [name]  | [section]      | [removed/deprecated] |
| ...     | ...     | ...            | ...                  |

### INACCURATE Documentation

| Gap ID  | Feature | What's Wrong     | Correct Behavior  |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| GAP-XXX | [name]  | [incorrect info] | [actual behavior] |
| ...     | ...     | ...              | ...               |

### INCOMPLETE Documentation

| Gap ID  | Feature | What's Missing |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| GAP-XXX | [name]  | [missing info] |
| ...     | ...     | ...            |

## Priority Indicators

### High Priority Gaps

Features that new users would immediately encounter or need:

1. GAP-XXX: [feature] - [reason]
2. ...

### Medium Priority Gaps

Features that regular users would use:

1. GAP-XXX: [feature] - [reason]
2. ...

### Low Priority Gaps

Advanced features or edge cases:

1. GAP-XXX: [feature] - [reason]
2. ...
```

## Guidelines

- **Be specific** - Include file paths and line numbers where possible
- **Focus on user impact** - Why would a user care about this gap?
- **Check both directions** - Missing features AND stale docs
- **Note severity** - Some gaps matter more than others
- **Verify gaps** - Make sure it's actually a discrepancy, not a false positive
